## Learn More

This project was created using **React.js** and **Material UI**, with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** used for basic structure and functionality.

- **HTML**: Used for creating the basic structure of the website. 
- **CSS**: Applied for styling the website, though the design and layout were mainly driven by **Material UI**. 
- **JavaScript**: Used for basic interactivity, although most dynamic functionality is handled by **React.js**.
- **React.js**: The core technology used for building a modern and dynamic user interface, allowing for component-based architecture and state management. 
- **Material UI**: Used extensively for designing the user interface with pre-built components and ensuring responsiveness. 

These technologies together allow for the creation of responsive and interactive web applications with minimal backend dependencies.
